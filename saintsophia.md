# Saint Sophia's Inscriptions

The <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/research/digital-documentation-of-inscriptions-in-the-saint-sophia-cathedral-in-kyiv">Saint Sophia's Inscriptions project</a> is led by Gunnar Almevik and Jonathan Westin at University of Gothenburg. The backend is developed as an initial clone of the [Diana database coordination solution](https://github.com/gu-gridh/diana-backend), developed by GRIDH and is available <a href="https://github.com/gu-gridh/Saint_Sophia/">here</a>. The project frontend is developed as a part of the <a href="https://github.com/gu-gridh/multimodal-map#multimodal-map">Multimodal Map</a> project, a repository of user interface modules developed by GRIDH specifically aimed at spatio-temporal visualisations. The data explorer tools are developed as part of the <a href="https://github.com/gu-gridh/multimodal-viewer#multimodal-viewer">Multimodal Viewer</a> project.
