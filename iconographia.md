# Iconographia Mediaevalis Suetica

## Database and API documentation
Under construction...


## Dataset documentation
The Historical Museum’s image database “Medeltidens bildvärld”, featuring photographs taken by Lennart Karlsson between 1990 and 1996 (digitized as part of the Mapping Lived Religion project), along with the “Ikonografiska Registret” from the Antiquarian-Topographical Archive (ATA), constitute the first collections. The goal is for Iconographia to be gradually expanded with material from additional sources.
