# Iconographia Mediaevalis Suetica

## Database and API documentation
Under construction...


## Dataset documentation
The Historical Museum’s image database “Medeltidens bildvärld”, featuring photographs taken by Lennart Karlsson between 1990 and 1996 (digitized as part of the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/node/6128">Mapping Lived Religion</a> project), along with the “Ikonografiska Registret” from the Antiquarian-Topographical Archive (ATA), constitute the first collections. The goal is for Iconographia to be gradually expanded with material from additional sources.
